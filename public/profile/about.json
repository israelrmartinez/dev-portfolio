    "about": " I am a recent graduate from UW-Seattle with a B.S. in Informatics: Human-Computer Interaction.\n\n\nAs someone who is just starting their career, my goal is to utilize my skill set to work with a diverse group of people and create products that make an impact on consumers. Currently, my main field of interest is software development and UX/UI Design, but I also have a strong interest in data analytics and research.\n\nExample Paragraph: I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.",
